Experimental JavaScript library for playing sound loops mapped to scroll
positions of a web page.

ðŸ”— [Demo: https://websound56.benleavez.com](https://websound56.benleavez.com)

**Concept and sound design by
[Bence Csontos a.k.a Ben Leavez](https://benleavez.com).**

## Usage

1. Upload sound loop files to the `assets` folder.

2. Edit the `src/config.json` file to reference the uploaded files and set up
   loop segments.

3. To integrate into your website add the following `<script>` tag to the
   `<head>` or before the closing tag of your `<body>`:

```
<script defer="defer" src="https://websound56.benleavez.com/app.js"></script>
```

## Development

Changes pushed to the `main` branch are automatically built and deployed to
GitHub Pages published at
[https://websound56.benleavez.com](https://websound56.benleavez.com). Automation
is handled by GitHub Actions (see
[workflow file](https://github.com/balintk/websound56/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)).

The following scripts are available for development.
