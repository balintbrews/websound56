Experimental JavaScript library for playing sound loops mapped to scroll
positions of a web page.

**Concept and sound design by
[Bence Csontos a.k.a Ben Leavez](https://benleavez.com).**

## Development

Changes pushed to the `main` branch are automatically built and deployed to
GitHub Pages published at
[https://websound56.benleavez.com](https://websound56.benleavez.com). Automation
is handled by GitHub Actions (see
[workflow file](https://github.com/balintk/websound56/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)).

The following scripts are available for development.
